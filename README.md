<p>This is a plugin which does a few things:</p>
<ul>
<li>Creates a custom post type for the individual Top Trump cards
<ul><li>The Custom post type was made to be scalable, so you need to assign a category to the posts - that way you can have many sets of Top Trump cards</li></ul></li>
<li>Creates a custom page template to host each set of Top Trump cards
<ul><li>At the moment it just displays the current set of cards</li>
<li>I would have liked to update the template to have only two fields, the title of the set and the category / name of set. That way you can have many sets each with individual pages to link to </li></ul></li>
<li>Added 'favourites' functionality - this doesn't account for having no favourites currently!</li>
<li>Created a sort on each attribute - will also sort 'favourites' if selected</li>
<li>I started to create 'compare' functionality, but realised I didn't have time to complete it.
<ul><li>If you click on the 'sort by' button the attributes buttons disappear - this was to make space for the 'compare' button</li></ul></ul>
<p>What's left:</p>
<li>Add the editor field back into the custom post to allow for the origin story to be written in</li>
<li>Creat compare functionality. Allowing the user to compare two cards only in a modal overlay. An icon indicating which attribute trumps the other card's attribute would be displayed next to each attribute</li>
<li>On sort, highlight, on the cards, the attribute sorted on, for easier comparison</li>
<li>Finish the page template to enable full scalability</li>
<li>Animate the cards onto the screen when viewing favourites</li>
<li>Add a 'no favourites selected' notice to account for that</li>
<li>Remove Bootstrap</li>
<li>Remove Fontawesome</li>
<li>Make the page properly responsive, semantic and accessible</li>
<li>Tested more throughly across browsers and devices - it has only been tested briefly in Chrome and Safari.</li></ul>
