<p>This is a plugin which does a few things:</p>
<ul>
<li>Creates a custom post type for the individual Top Trump cards
<ul>
<li>The Custom post type was made to be scalable, so you need to assign a category to the posts - that way you can have many sets of Top Trump cards</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Creates a custom page template to host each set of Top Trump cards
<ul>
<li>At the moment it just displays the current set of cards
<li>I will update the template to have only two fields, the title of the set and the category / name of set</li>
<li>That way you can have many sets each with individual pages to link to </li>
</ul>
<li>Displayed the current set on a page and added some styling</li>
</ul>
<p>Next I plan to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Finish the styling
<li>Add compare functionality where the user can select two cards for comparison in a modal overlay</li>
<li>Add a 'favourites' functionality, which allows the user to view only the cards they have selected as their 'favourites'</li>
<li>Update the custom page template as mentioned above</li>
<li>Tidy up the code!</li>
</ul>
